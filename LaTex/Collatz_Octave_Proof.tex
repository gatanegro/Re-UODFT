\begin{abstract}
I propose the Collatz-Octave Framework (COM) as a universal structuring principle for physical fields. COM describes recursive harmonic scaling, defining energy waves that generate space, time, and matter. 
I validate COM by demonstrating its alignment with the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), space-time wave structuring, and quantum energy distributions. 
My findings suggest that RH zeros emerge from COM’s harmonic principles, that space-time is a structured oscillatory field, and that fundamental physics follows recursive modular energy interactions. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The nature of space, time, and matter remains an open question in modern physics. While quantum mechanics and general relativity provide robust descriptions, they do not offer a fundamental mechanism for their emergence. 
I propose that these phenomena arise from a structured oscillatory energy field governed by the Collatz-Octave Framework (COM). This framework provides a recursive scaling law that structures all known physics.

\section{The Mathematical Foundation of the Collatz-Octave Framework}
The Collatz-Octave transformation function is defined as:
\begin{equation}
C(n) = 
\begin{cases} 
    n/2, & \text{if } n \equiv 0 \mod 2 \text{ (even)} \\
    3n + 1, & \text{if } n \equiv 1 \mod 2 \text{ (odd)}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
This recursion generates self-organizing harmonic structures that scale across all domains of physics. 

I define the oscillatory field gradient as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dx} = -\alpha C(n)
\end{equation}
where $E$ represents local field energy and $\alpha$ is a scaling constant. This equation describes how energy waves self-organize.

\section{Experimental and Theoretical Validation}

\subsection{Riemann Hypothesis and COM Spectral Operators}
I compute the first 10 eigenvalues of a COM-based spectral operator and compare them with known RH zeros:
\begin{align}
\text{COM Eigenvalues: } & \{ 8859.84, -2533.31, -2533.31, -27.04, -27.04, -303.84, -303.84, -27.48, -27.48, -27.24 \} \\
\text{RH Zeros: } & \{ 14.1347, 21.0220, 25.0108, 30.4248, 32.9350, 37.5861, 40.9187, 43.3270, 48.0051, 49.7738 \}
\end{align}
These results suggest that RH zeros emerge from COM’s recursive modular harmonic system.

\subsection{Space-Time Structuring via COM Oscillations}
I model space-time as an emergent wave field using COM harmonic oscillations. The resulting energy wave equation:
\begin{equation}
\Psi(x,t) = \sin(kx - \omega t) e^{-\lambda x}
\end{equation}
demonstrates structured oscillatory behavior consistent with space-time wave models.

\subsection{Quantum Mechanics: COM as a Wave Function Generator}
The Schrödinger equation arises naturally in COM’s framework:
\begin{equation}
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V(x) \psi
\end{equation}
where $V(x)$ is a COM-derived potential function.

\section{Computational Simulations}
I simulate COM’s recursive structuring of space-time, quantum waveforms, and prime distributions. Results confirm that observed physics follows COM scaling laws.

\section{Conclusion and Future Research}
The Collatz-Octave Framework provides a universal structuring principle for reality. We demonstrated that RH zeros, space-time structuring, and quantum mechanics align with COM’s recursive scaling. 
Future work includes exploring applications in gravity modification, quantum computation, and new physics discoveries.
