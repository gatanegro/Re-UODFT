# Step 2: Testing BSD Conjecture Numerically Using Elliptic Curves

# Define an elliptic curve equation y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
x, y = symbols('x y')
a, b = -1, 1  # Example elliptic curve parameters

# Define the elliptic curve equation
elliptic_curve_eq = Eq(y**2, x**3 + a*x + b)

# Solve for rational points on the curve (integer solutions for testing)
rational_solutions = []
for x_val in range(-10, 11):
    solutions = solve(elliptic_curve_eq.subs(x, x_val), y)
    for sol in solutions:
        if sol.is_rational:
            rational_solutions.append((x_val, sol))

# Count the number of rational points (finite or infinite approximation)
num_rational_points = len(rational_solutions)

# Compute an approximation of the L-function behavior at s=1 using a basic heuristic
L_E_1_approx = 1 / (1 + num_rational_points)  # Approximation: L(E,1) drops as rank increases

# Return numerical results for BSD testing
num_rational_points, L_E_1_approx
